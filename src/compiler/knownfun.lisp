;;; IR1 boolean function attributes
;;;
;;; There are a number of boolean attributes of known functions which
;;; we like to have in IR1. This information is mostly side effect
;;; information of a sort, but it is different from the kind of
;;; information we want in IR2. We aren't interested in a fine
;;; breakdown of side effects, since we do very little code motion on
;;; IR1. We are interested in some deeper semantic properties such as
;;; whether it is safe to pass stack closures to.
;;;
;;; FIXME: This whole notion of "bad" explicit attributes is bad for
;;; maintenance. How confident are we that we have no defknowns for functions
;;; with functional arguments that are missing the CALL attribute? Much better
;;; to have NO-CALLS, as it is much less likely to break accidentally.

  ;; (since it "is an error" to modify a constant), we choose not to
  ;; mark these functions as foldable in this database.
  foldable

  ;; effects except possibly cons. If a function might signal errors,
  ;; then it is not flushable even if it is movable, foldable or

  ;; type checking of arguments is always performed by the caller, so
  ;; a function which SHOULD signal an error if arguments are not of
  ;; declared types may be FLUSHABLE.)
